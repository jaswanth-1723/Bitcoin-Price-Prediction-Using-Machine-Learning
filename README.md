## Result
Based on the project's findings, it is evident that Bitcoin's price is influenced by various factors. The proposed predictive model, which incorporates multiple parameters, was able to accurately forecast Bitcoin's closing price for the following day. The model can be helpful for investors and traders looking to make informed decisions about buying or selling Bitcoin.
